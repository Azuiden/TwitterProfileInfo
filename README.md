## Twitter info profile scrapper
This code uses twitter API pull profile information from a user's follow list. Twitter API doesn't allow you to pull birthday, so it also uses chromedriver to scrape that information.  The information is loaded into a indexed list that can be uploaded into a google spreadsheet using gspread.
